Compilation:-

mpic++ main.cpp -o parallel

Running on P processors using MPI:-

mpiexec -n P parallel -f <DATAFILE> -m <MODELFILE> -l

For example, running on P=4 processors on input file a9a :-

mpiexec -n 4 parallel -f a9a -m a9a.model -l

We have also provided the script we used for timing our simulations.
To run it on a9a, type:-

bash sim.bash -f a9a

It will create the model file in ./models/a9a.model
It will record the timings in ./sims/a9a.sim
[Both the models and sims directories should exist!]
